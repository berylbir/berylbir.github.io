ðŸ˜Š I have passed the preliminary exam! For the exam, I presented Erdal Arikan's paper, "Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels." I received positive feedback from my committee on my presentation and understanding of the material.
